dotCover antlib
================
A project to run JetBrains dotCover (http://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/) from ANT (not NANT)

This ANT task was written with dotCover 1.0 in mind, if something changes, I can't
guarantee it will work properly.


Why?
================
Because dotCover uses xml files to read the configuration, which makes it a little bit
problematic since the configuration for the coverage is not place in one place (at the
build.xml) which makes maintenance a little bit harder.

Please note that I am in no way involved with JetBrains and it's dotCover product except
for being a user of the tool.
JetBrains and me are NOT involved in any way.

This project was created because I had a specific problem and needed to fix it. I'm sharing
the solution with the community so it can solve more problems.


Building
================
Just type ANT (assuming ANT is in your path) at the root dir of the project.

It should build and output the jar at the out dir.
 
How to use?
================
In your build.xml:

<!-- Import the task -->
<taskdef resource="com/egmas/ant/tasks/dotcover/antlib.xml">
	<classpath>
		<pathelement location="build/antlib/dotcover_antlib.jar" />
	</classpath>
</taskdef>

<!-- At your coverage target -->
<dotCover workingDir="path/to/test_assemblies" execPath="path/to/dotCover.exe" xmlout="path/to/coverage-dotcover.xml" nunitPath="path/to/nunit-console-x86.exe">
	<IncludeFilters>
		<FilterEntry>
			<ModuleMask>ProjectNamespace*</ModuleMask>
			<ClassMask>*</ClassMask>
			<FunctionMask>*</FunctionMask>
		</FilterEntry>
	</IncludeFilters>

	<ExcludeFilters>
		<FilterEntry>
			<ModuleMask>ProjectNamespace.*.Tests</ModuleMask>
			<ClassMask>*</ClassMask>
			<FunctionMask>*</FunctionMask>
		</FilterEntry>
	</ExcludeFilters>

	<testassembly name="ProjectNamespace.Math.Tests.dll" />
	<testassembly name="ProjectNamespace.Simulator.Tests.dll" />
</dotCover>

This requires that you provide the correct paths to dotCover.exe and nunit-console-x86.exe

Task documentation
================
<dotCover
	workingDir="" -> Required. What will be written at the WorkingDir section at the Coverage step
	execPath=""   -> Required. The path to dotCover.exe
	xmlout=""	  -> Required. The full path to the xml coverage file which will be written. It's the <Output> at the Report step
	nunitPath=""  -> Required. The path to the nunit runner (usually nunit-console-x86.exe). It's the <Executable> at the Coverage step
	tempDir=""	  -> Optional. The temporary dir. Uses the system temp dir if not specified
	>
	<testassembly name="ProjectTest.dll"> -> At least one element of <testassembly> type is required
	
	<IncludeFilters> and <ExcludeFilters> -> Optional. These are the same as the dotCover xml, see their documentation for more information
</dotCover>

Internals
================
If you run dotCover.exe from the command line, you'll notice that there are three steps:

- Coverage
- Merge
- Report

What this task does is writing a XML file for each step then run dotCover for each step
with that XML file in mind.



What's missing?
================
- Add MSTest support (I don't use MSTest, so I'm probably not adding it in the near future, but it should be very easy)
- Add support to run the test assemblies on their own directory by setting the WorkingDir at the coverage step
